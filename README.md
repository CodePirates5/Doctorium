# Doctorium

# Problem Identified from Danielson Eye Care Centre and  Dental Clinic 
They use a manual system to record  appointments and bookings  
Patients travel long distance to check for medical results at the centre/clinic.
Patients access products and services directly at the centre/clinic

# Solution
We  propose to develop a booking and appointment mobile application for Danielson Eye Care Centre and  Dental Clinic according to their requirements and problems identified. The proposed solution  will  provide products and services  to patients online. Patients will be able to make appointments, check available slots, receive medical prescriptions and  results and receive counselling  from doctors. 
The reason for choosing a mobile based solution is because of its potability, light-weight, pervasiveness, easy  and faster to implement and cost effective.
